        <p>The castle had old bones, bones the dwarves had pulled deep from the earth and planted back in it, bones which had kept out the trolls bones which had held up kings.</p>
        <p id="trigger2">They were bones which had been bitten by the aching maw of an infant teething Time, bones which had crumbled when the dwarves fled in the olden days.</p>
        <p id="trigger3">They were bones that had grown lonely sitting in the Great Plains on their own, watching the dome of the sky and feeling the grip of the earth and longing for the embrace of the mountains from which they had once come.</p>

        <p>The House of Rowan was one of the ancient families who had sworn fealty by the Pact of the Spindle. They had fought alongside John of the Harp in the Giants’ Wars. The House of Rowan had tamed the three-headed bear that ravaged the mountain towns. Like the bones of the castle, the House of Rowan had been old and powerful. Like the bones of the castle, they had crumbled from their glory.</p>
        <p>The bones of the castle were forgotten, drifted into the folds of history. Only the villages ever thought of the thick, decaying stone walls that cut into the hillside like a scar and echoed, when the winds blew right, with the dwarves’ ancient songs.</p>
        <p>The House of Rowan refused to be forgotten, so it gave up its kingdom and swore its loyalty to a more powerful crown. It was given a small stretch of land to care for and a few villages of people to tax and a small heap of stones that had once been a mighty castle.</p>
        <p>They took the bones and covered them with new skin. They restrung the muscles and gave the castle rebirth. And then they lived there, and they called it their palace — because they thought it sounded nicer — and with their small fortune and meager governance they settled into the fold of the years.</p>

        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>She was the eldest child of the House of Rowan and third in line for the Seat of the Lord after her two younger brothers.
        The older of the two was thin and sickly and no one expected him to amount to much or even see the start of his twentieth year. The younger, however, was as healthy as an ox and had the frame to match. He was already being groomed for the seat, which left the Damsel assigned the chores her mother had been taught to excel at: needlework, pie-baking, and looking pretty.</p>
        <p>She did her best, though her body and spirit were not suited to a doll-like life tucked upon a shelf in the palace. Her lungs were stronger in the fresh air of the mountains, her heart beat faster in the hold of the forest, her eyes saw better among the waving fields of grain, her thoughts were clearer next to the rush of the river, her smile grew wider under the bask of silvery stars.</p>
        <p>But she knew her place, and it was within the old bones of the palace, at her mother’s knee and beneath her father’s watchful eye.  She did her best, tucked herself into a delicate gown, wrapped her hair into delicate braids, decorated her hands with delicate rings, wore a delicate smile. She did her best to be the perfect daughter her parents wanted, but she never quite mastered it. Her fingers were not made for delicate tasks like embroidery.</p>
        <p>Time after time she had pricked a finger, only to wipe it on the pale gowns her mother had her dressed in, leaving a long scarlet streak. Her mother watched until she could no longer stand it, and swore to dress the Damsel only in red until the day she put on a pale dress to be wed.</p>
        <p>The letter came with all the proper pomp, carried by a herald whose natural position seemed to be bent so far at the waist that his nose scraped his knees and the long feather on his hat brushed the ground.</p>
        <p>The Damsel never saw it arrive, never knew it existed until her mother announced the happy news over their embroidery that evening. She found herself wondering what it would have been like to know about her engagement before the rest of the kingdom.</P>
        <p>But it was not her place to wonder such things, so the Damsel kept her tongue behind her teeth, where it whipped and writhed like some wild animal caught in a trap. She looked at her mother and painted a smile on her face and said the two words she knew her ladyship wanted to hear, the two words she was expected to say.</p>
        <p>“How wonderful.”</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>It was only by merit of a great-grandfather — who had squandered much of the fortune of the House of Rowan on a bargain with a dragon — that the Damsel managed to get her way and convince her mother to let her be the one to travel across the Feywoods and deliver the news to her grandmother. The castle was short-staffed, the House could only pay so many servants and, after all, they were all busy preparing for the ceremony.</p>
        <p>It was also by merit of the way her mother was only paying half the attention she should have. With the fabric of the white dress under her fingertips, she heard as much of the music that had played at her own wedding as she did the words of her daughter.</p>
        <p>The Damsel’s thoughts, however, were unclouded by a fog of pleasant memories, so as soon as permission was given, the Damsel threw a red mantle over her red dress, packed a day’s worth of supplies into a bag, and set out through the palace gates.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>The trees in the Feywoods were wild things with gnarled knuckles and violent voices that spoke only in shouts, and only when the wind was gusting.<p>
        <p>Grandmother Rowan lived on the other side of the Feywoods in her own castle on a lumpy hill. The hill was, in actuality, the tomb of the last great Troll King. It was placed on the site from where Her Majesty had launched her campaign against the dwarves and their castle with old bones.</p>
        <p>Grandmother Rowan had a bedroom with a massive bed, opulent decorations, and a wide window that looked out over the forest. In the distance, the top spire of the Castle Rowan scraped out over the writing tops of the trees like a lonely finger.</p>
        <p>When the Damsel and her brothers were younger, Grandmother Rowan would laugh and pinch their cheeks and tell them to mind the fairies in the woods. Then Grandfather Rowan had followed a woman wearing the face of a fox into the woods and he never came back out.</p>
        <p>She kept telling her grandchildren to mind the fairies in the woods, but she no longer said it with a playful glint in her eye.</p>
        <p>Every time the Damsel looked into the trees a sudden thrill played across her heart and she heard her grandmother’s words.</p>
        <p>“Mind the fairies.”</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>There was a single road that cut through the trees, which had, over the years, become as gnarled as the boughs above it. It had once been paved with fine stones laid in gentle whorls. That had been back when the trees were young and innocent and weak, back before they had learned their roots could shift mountains and crack stones. It had been long before the House of Rowan had placed itself in the castle with old bones.</p>
        <p>When the Damsel walked along the road there were no gentle whorls. The trees, now old and bitter and strong had twisted the spirals into knots and lightning strikes. It had pushed stones up and pulled them down until no carriage could cross it and no horse dared — there were things in those woods they didn’t need to see to be spooked. It was a journey to be taken on foot.</p>
        <p>Things moved behind the trunks, danced at the edge of the Damsel’s vision. She did her best to ignore them. She had found that, sometimes, the best thing to do was imagine they weren’t there.</p>
        <p>One thing, in particular, watched with an acute, needle-like hunger. Its eyes narrowed behind holes in a long-snouted mask covered in a wolf’s fur. It was hard to tell where the mask ended and her face began.</p>
        <p>The Damsel didn’t see the figure in the wolf mask. Instead, she kept on her way through the woods, keeping to the path like her grandmother always warned.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>In the woods, there was a clearing spattered with wildflowers. There was a well in the center of the grassy round. Moss covered the stones.</p>
        <p>There was an old bucket, stained and warped with years of seeping, dripping water that hung alongside a dented tin cup on a small hook in the well. The Damsel had paused to refill her water skin.</p>
        <p>She spun when she heard the dainty cough bounce around the trees, running around the circle like the laugh of a feral dog.</p>
        <p>There was a not-quite-woman at the edge of the clearing. She certainly looked like a woman, except for the delicate fingers that all seemed crooked and bent the wrong way, except for the eyes that shone silver, except for the wolf mask that almost seemed part of her face. Besides that, she seemed human.</p>
        <p>A complex network of fine silver chains danced and wove across her arms. They seemed, for all the world, like fine jewelry until they reached her wrist and tangled into one thick chain that wrapped around the neck of an emaciated, matted-hair child with a wild look in his eyes not a stitch of fabric on him. He was slowly licking a particularly grimly spot on his arm. She was running a bent hand through his hair.</p>
        <p>She sneered at the Damsel in something that almost passed for a smile as she entered the clearing. She blinked slowly, watching with interest. She slowly licked her lips, a scarlet tongue pricked out from between needle teeth.</p>
        <p>“How now, my Damsel?” Her voice was as sweet as honey and drunk as wine and deep as the centuries that had led up to this moment. She ran a hand through her shimmering grey locks and they danced like water down her back.</p>
        <p>It took the Damsel a moment to pick apart the noise of the woman’s voice from the hum of the forest.</p>
        <p>“Where are you headed, my dear?” The woman asked.</p>
        <p>“Ahead of me,” the Damsel replied, as she had been taught to do when speaking to fairies — for, indeed, the woman was one. The eyes behind the mask narrowed slightly.</p>
        <p>“Where do you come from?” The fairy tried.</p>
        <p>“Behind me,” the Damsel replied. The fairy smiled a smile that didn’t reach her silver eyes.</p>
        <p>“What business takes you there?”</p>
        <p>“That which I have been tasked with.”</p>
        <p>At that, the fairy’s lips split apart, but with needles in one’s mouth, such as were in hers, it becomes hard to tell if it’s a smile or a snarl.</p>
        <p>“You are a very clever child,” the Damsel said with her honeyed ancient voice. “Your parents must be proud of you.”</p>
        <p>The Damsel inclined her head slightly in acknowledgment but offered no thanks for fear of creating a debt with this tricksy beast.</p>
        <p>There was a sudden rustle like the hem of a gown across dead leaves or the flutter of gossamer wings, and the woman was standing right in front of the Damsel. She could count the crystals woven into the fine lace of the hem on the gown, see the gentle shimmer of the wine-colored velvet, could smell the rot of death and human flesh on her breath. Her necklace was strung with a hand’s-worth of human bone, polished to a gemstone sheen. The Damsel couldn’t help take a step back.</p>
        <p>“I knew a girl once, about your size,” the fairy hissed sweetly. “She had the same eyes, the same lips, the same tender looking flesh. I showed her the most beautiful flowers that grow just by here. I could show you if you’d like. They’re as colorful as gemstones and just as precious and smell sweeter than blackberry pie.”</p>
        <p>The Damsel thought that, for a moment, she could smell the floral saccharine scent. She shook her head once to clear the stench from her nostrils and a second time to refuse and a third time for good measure as she tried to step past the fairy, who shot a hand out to grab the Damsel’s upper arm.</p>
        <p>Her fingers may have been crooked and bent, but they were strong as manacles. The smooth looking skin felt warty and callused. The carefully stitched hem of the sleeve felt rough and frayed.</p>
        <p>The nails felt exactly as they looked: sharp as daggers. They left fine red lines where they traced across the Damsel’s skin.</p>
        <p>She shivered at the touch and tensed her arm to wrench it away.</p>
        <p>“No need to struggle,” the fairy said quickly. Immediately, and without her volition, the Damsel felt her arm go slack. She found the silver eyes locked onto her own, felt a probing gaze that seemed to be reaching into her skull. “I’ll find you again, once you’ve had time to consider my offer.”</p>
        <p>Then the fairy in the wolf mask was gone, leaving behind the sound of a child’s whimpers, the scent of death, and a gossamer rustle that the Damsel could feel trembling through the air.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>There was a mouse that lived in the woods. His fur was the deep chestnut color of rich dirt in the sunlight, except where it was speckled grey with age. His eyes sparked with cleverness and, though he wasn’t of the Fey, his fur sparked slightly with magic.</p>
        <p>He was most beloved by the Mouse King, a favorite of her Highness the Mouse Queen and the pride of all mousedom, at least, insofar as the Feywoods Mice were concerned, which was precisely as far as the trees reached. They loved him for his ingenious designs and extreme creativity. It was he who had made the ornate palace in which the King and Queen resided, and for which they had named him Master Architect of the Forest Mice.</p>
        <p>He had been a human once, loved by them as well, save for the witch who cursed him. He wasted no time in trying to foil the enchantment, instead, finding the nearest of his new kind and doing his best to make himself useful to them. The result was a palace so ornate that, was it large enough, the face of every member of the House of Rowan stretching back ad infinitum would burn in shame and envy at the sight.</p>
        <p>It was, therefore, marked as a day of tragedy when a fairy in a wolf mask plucked him from the ephemera of the forest floor, snapped his neck with crooked fingers, and fed his still warm corpse to the wild-eyed child she kept on a chain.</p>
        <p>The Mouse King began wandering aimlessly around the halls, the Mouse Queen began ripping out tufts of her fur. The fairy just smiled her needle-tooth smile.</p>
        <p>The mouse palace, all its leave and twigs and beauty, stood at the base of an enormous granite pillar, carved by windstorms and rainstorms and eddying currents of magic. The fairy tied her pet, the wild-eyed boy, to the pillar and hung her dress over a nearby branch. She took off her wolf mask and her youthful beauty and slipped an old worn cloak over her shoulders instead.</p>
        <p>When the Damsel came upon the stone pillar at the heart of the woods she found an old crone leaning against the rough bark of an elm tree. A wild-looking cat was tethered to the column, its fur was matted and thick.</p>
        <p>“Pardon me dearie duck,” the crone rasped, “I’m ever so thirsty, you wouldn’t happen to have a drop to spare of something to drink, would you?”</p>
        <p>The Damsel knew to mind the fairies, but she also knew to help those in need, so, without a moment’s hesitation, she pulled out the flask and handed it to the old woman, who gripped it with crooked fingers.</p>
        <p>The sudden twist in her stomach told the Damsel this was the fairy, but she dared snatch the flask back.</p>
        <p>The fairy sipped from its mouth only for a moment, but when the Damsel held it again there was barely a moist drop left inside.</p>
        <p>“Oh, dearie dear, I seem to have taken more than my fill. Don’t you fret on that though, duck. There’s a cool, clean pond no more than a stone’s throw in that direction. These knees are too old to climb that hill, but yours look fresh as young saplings. You should have no trouble,” the crone chattered. “Back in my youth, when I could make my way there, there were handsome young men in the pond who would play music as I drank.”</p>
        <p>The Damsel had heard of the young men who lived in the forest ponds and along the banks of its streams. She had also heard of their habit of pulling young women under the lapping flow until the air left their lungs and the warmth left their body and they were left as limp and lifeless as a ragdoll.</p>
        <p>She acknowledged the fairy’s advice and turned, thirsty, away from the hill to set off along the path once more. And the fairy watched her leave and cursed in ancient words, spittle flying from her scarlet tongue as she watched the Damsel disappear into the trees once more.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>Near the edge of the woods the road split. The main road continued into the rolling hills that, eventually found the path of a river and faded into the next kingdom over. Off the main road meandered a smaller path.</p>
        <p>It was in better shape than the road it split from, its cobbles still whole and level, maintained and paid for from Grandmother Rowan’s own coffer.</p>
        <p>As the Damsel turned down the smaller path, with the sinking sun just starting to turn the sky to slow-dripping amber she heard a whistling she hadn’t heard in years and a laugh that only lasted in her memories. Through the trees wandered the figure of the long-lost Grandfather Rowan.</p>
        <p>The Damsel didn’t hesitate. She turned from the path and followed the figure through the trees. She didn’t notice the fairy standing just off the path behind her, her skin young and smooth again, the wolf mask fixed firmly, once more, to her face.</p>
        <p>As the Damsel crunched her way off into the trees the fairy turned down the path to the only place it led, the palace of Grandmother Rowan.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>Grandfather Rowan had stopped beneath the branches of an elder tree. He was propped against his sword with a jaunty grin thrown across his face like a valiant knight. When he saw the Damsel, his eyes lit up like the had when she was a child.</p>
        <p>He reached out to touch her hair and his touch felt like a breath of win and he laughed into the evening with the sound of bells chiming. His presence seemed wrapped up with sunshine and sudden rain and warm nights.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the summertime memory that enveloped him, the Damsel realized his fingers were bent and crooked, and behind the smell of rain on soil and of growing things and of gathering ozone was a creeping scent of death. As she looked at his face she realized she was looking into her own memories, to happier days when he hadn’t been lost to the fairies of the woods. He looked back at her with sad silver eyes.</p>
        <p>Her hands pulled through the memory like they’d pull through mist and he shimmered and burst apart in a cloud of thunderstorms and putrid-smelling rot.</p>
        <p>There was a dagger, an enchanted blade with a hilt made from a dwarf’s bone and a blade made of cold, folded iron marked with runes of the same ancient language the fairies used. It had a knack for being heavier and more solid than it looked, of pulling a fighter’s hand in just the right way, eager to fight. It clung loyally to its owner, like a true hound dog. In life, Grandfather Rowan had worn it on his hip. In memory it was no different, and true to its character, where he faded away into a shower of misty magic, it fell with a thud as heavy-sounding as a footstep deep in an underground cavern, bouncing back against the piles of rock above it.</p>
        <p>It hummed slightly, happily purred as the Damsel held it in her hand and turned toward the palace of Grandmother Rowan.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>The castle ran like clockwork. Grandmother Rowan would have it no other way. The servants moved with an oiled, mechanical precision, marched around the place with the efficiency of a marching second hand.</p>
        <p>Yet, when the Damsel arrived, the gates were sluggish to open, the guards were slow to usher her inside, the castle moved as if walking in its sleep.</p>
        <p>The cook in the kitchen looked like she was dreaming of mutton pies, the captain of the guard looked as if he were dreaming of the soft, sharp bite of steel into flesh, the court fool looked like he was dreaming to the tune of a galloping foxtrot.</p>
        <p>The Damsel climbed the stairs to Grandmother Rowan’s chambers and found the grand dame busy at work, doing her embroidery. Her eyes were wide and clear, her movements were precise and quick. Here was no sleepwalker.</p>
        <p>“Your castle has been cursed with fairy magic.” The Damsel explained about the fairy in the wolf mask.</p>
        <p>“You know what they say,” Grandmother Rowan replied, “‘Mind the fairies.’ But darling, you look horrible.” The red dress was ripped at the bottom and stained dark with traces of the forest floor. Her arm was still marked red, where the fairy’s nails had scratched her. Her hair was tangled with twigs from her journey off the path.</p>
        <p>“Come here,” Grandmother Rowan patted the stool next to her regal chair, “and tell me all about your journey.”</p>
        <p>The Damsel fell onto the seat and let out a long sigh. Grandmother Rowan was no matronly figure. She was as slim and polished as a gemstone, and often just as cold, but with her grandchildren that crystalline shell cracked, if only a little, and a hint of warmth escaped.</p>
        <p>She told Grandmother Rowan of the woman with the wolf’s face and the breath of death, told her of the promise of beautiful flowers. She told her of the crone and the flask and the promise of crystal-cool waters. She told her of the apparition of Grandfather Rowan and the journey through the woods.</p>
        <p>With each word, she felt her grandmother’s arms pulling her closer to safety.</p>
        <p>She looked up into her grandmother’s eyes and smiled, but her lips caught in the movement as she noted a strange sparkle in her grandmother’s eyes, a strange quicksilver shimmer.</p>
        <p>“Grandmother Rowan, what strange eyes you have,” the Damsel said pulling back.</p>
        <p>“They shimmer with the joy of seeing you, my dear.”</p>
        <p>The Damsel started to pull away, and Grandmother Rowan latched her fingers around her arm. They fit like a cuff and were as strong. Behind the perfect delicate digits, the Damsel could feel the bends and warps and crooked lines.</p>
        <p>“Grandmother Rowan, what strange fingers you have,” the Damsel muttered, wriggling and twisting and trying to break free. It was no use. The grip pulled her closer until she could smell the rotting flesh.</p>
        <p>“They are so glad to hold you again, my dear.”</p>
        <p>A scarlet tongue poked out from between her Grandmother’s carefully painted lips. Needle-like teeth pricked the skin. The Damsel could feel herself being drawn toward those lips, that tongue, those teeth. Her free hand had begun to scrabble against her grandmother’s chest, against the steely grip on her wrist, anywhere where she hoped she might find purchase or a tool to help free herself.</p>
        <p>“Grandmother Rowan, what strange teeth you have.”</p>
        <p>“They are so ready to taste your flesh, my dear.”</p>
        <p>In a moment the face and skin of her grandmother dropped away. The thing that had been inside was twisting and writhing and wriggling like a snake. It was a wyrm with scales like the night and wings spread wide. It was an ogre with terrible fangs and sandpaper skin. Then a row of needle teeth was in her shoulder and the Damsel was screaming in pain and it was a woman in a delicate gown, with steel grey hair splashing down her back, and the mask of a wolf attached to her features.</p>
        <p>The Damsel acted without thought. She felt as if her hand was pulled to her waist, pulled around the hilt of bone, but the knife knew she could do the rest on her own. When the rune-marked blade went into the fairy’s chest it was all of the Damsel’s own accord.</p>
        <p>The knife may have been stitched from a cloth of memories, but the dwarf bone and ancient runes made it strong and study and sharp and it cut through the fairy's skin and muscle and magic and bone in a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>The fairy sputtered and stuttered and wheezed and a slow stream of pitch pooled out from the wound. The grey fur began to molt and fall away leaving greying, parchment skin that crackled into the features of a beautiful young woman. Those too crackled into the face of the crone in the woods, before growing even older. The features grew gaunter, the cheeks more sunken. The hair went from steel to silver to snowy white before it began to drop in thick clumps, like dusty cobwebs. The eyes lost their spark until they sat cold as two spheres of heavy lead inside the fairy’s eye sockets.</p>
        <p>The sounds of the castle began to grow faster, sharper, and from somewhere the Damsel heard the voice of Grandmother Rowan barking her orders, sharp and cold and very much alive. On top of it, and so much nearer, there was the flutter of gossamer wings slowing to a standstill and the muted, heavy thud of two leaden balls falling into a pile of dust, already shifting in a draft.</p>
        <p class="divider"><i>— // —</i></p>
        <p>The crossroads looked different in the early morning light. It was greener, newer.</p>
        <p>The Damsel had found Grandmother Rowan in the kitchen, breathing down the cook’s neck. At the sight of her granddaughter, she had ordered an elaborate dinner to be spread.</p>
        <p>They had sat talking of mundane things, like her brother’s training to take up the Seat of the Lord Rowan, and the daily goings-on on each side of the Feywoods. Grandmother Rowan, in her usual fashion, reminded the Damsel to ‘mind the fairies.’</p>
        <p>She just smiled in reply and felt for the two leaden balls and a strip of delicate lace in her pocket.</p>
        <p>The Damsel had not told Grandmother Rowan of the intended wedding, and she wondered what sort of trouble that might bring, but in the end decided the result wouldn’t be too bad.</p>
        <p>There can be a difference between doing one’s duty and living one’s life, and with the memory of an enchanted knife strapped to her hip and the remnants of a fairy in her pocket the Damsel knew which she would rather do.</p>
        <p>So, standing in the newborn light of the day at the crossroads in the Feywoods, the Damsel took one last look back toward the palace of Grandmother Rowan, one more look down the road toward the castle with the old bones, and then set off on the path through the hills.</p>
        <p>After all, there was a slowly sparkling river out there, and beyond that, the world.</p>
